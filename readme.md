# Retro Game Console

This repository details the creation of a videogame console using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

## Overview

### Software

The core of this console is the retro X-Y graphics it features. X-Y graphics, (or vector graphics) render images by 'tracing' shapes over a period of time.

### Hardware

## Notes

This repository uses an open-source library for rendering X-Y video (libxy). The source for and documentation of this library can be found at https://github.com/colebarach/lib_xy_display. For information about the functionality of and design of X-Y monitors, another repository details the making of one from a CRT screen at https://github.com/colebarach/crt_xy_monitor.
