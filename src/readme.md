# Compilation

## Library Examples

Process:

 - Create a new directory named `build` and change the working directory into it.
 - Run `cmake ..` to generate the build files.
 - Run `cmake --build .` to compile the examples.
 - A new subdirectory for each example has been created, each containing a `.utf` file which may be flashed to the pico.
